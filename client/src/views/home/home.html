						Hi. My name is Logan. As you can probably
						tell from this photo, I like reading. I even
						found time to read at the beach.</p>
						<p class="text-topic-body">
						I definitely didn’t have time to read while
						I was on an exciting adventure. I am a
						boy who loves to take trips to places that
						I haven’t ever been. That’s where the
						excitement begins.</p>
						<p class="text-topic-body">
						If you read this book, you will meet many
						interesting and fun characters. These characters need
						my help and I plan on not letting them
						down.</p>
						<p class="text-topic-body">
						Wish me luck!
